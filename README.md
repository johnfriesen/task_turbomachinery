# Turbomachinery Student Project â€“ Pump Analysis (DHBW Karlsruhe)
This repository provides the project description and resources for students in the Turbomachinery course at DHBW Karlsruhe.

The goal of the project is to analyze the operating behavior of a water pump using real measurement data and manufacturer specifications. Students will create their own Jupyter Notebook to perform the required calculations and analysis.


# Project Context
- You are working with a water pump used in an industrial setup.
- The manufacturer's data sheet for the pump is available.
- The volumetric flow rate is measured after the pump and logged in a .csv file (volume_flow_data.csv).
- The impeller diameter is 264 mm.

# Your tasks
You will write a Jupyter Notebook that performs the following:

**1. Calculate the energy consumption**

Estimate the total energy used by the pump over the measured period using the available volumetric flow rate data.

**2. Determine average pump efficiency**

Use the volumentric flow rate to determine the average pump efficiency.

**3. Calculate unused energy**
Determine how much of the input energy was converted into hydraulic work.

**4. Optional: Add additional analyses**
Include helpful visualizations such as:
- Estimated power vs. time
- Histograms or boxplots of operating behavior

# Resources Provided
- Pump data sheet (https://ab-resale.com/wp-content/art_datasheets/AR4713.pdf)
- Volumentric Flow Rate CSV File

# Tools 
You are encouraged to use Jupyter Notebook.

# Submission instructions
Please submit your project by sending an email that includes the following:
- A link to your GitHub or GitLab repository

The repository must contain:
- A clear and concise README.md file explaining your work
- Your completed Jupyter Notebook with code, comments, and results

Deadline and email address will be announced during the course.
